I've only setup custom domains a couple of times over time and even though I feel like I should know far more about it as a developer, I do not. I remember these couple of times as horribly confused experiences with name servers and CNAME's and A records and reading multiple documentation and instructions that all seemed to say different things. I believe I eventually rang GoDaddy for help, hung my head in shame, and vowed never to tell a sole that I had to ring the help line.

I also recall a particularly awkward interview for a web administer job I had no business in applying for at the time.

Interviewer: "Can you tell me what a zone file is?"
Me: "Hmm I'm not sure but I'd imagine it's some kind of file that manages zones."
My brain: "Nailed it!"

I did not get the job.

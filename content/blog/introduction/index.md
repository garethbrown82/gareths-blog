Welcome to my blog. At this stage I'm not sure exactly what will be found in the pages of this blog but it will most likely be documented processes of certain development problems I run into and how I solve them. I'm always learning some new piece of web development technology and the best way to learn new tools is by creating projects using them. For example I've just learnt how to use Gatsby, so I'm now using it this very minute by writing a blog with it! I might share some other projects I create with other pieces of technology on this very blog as well.

It is unlikely I will write blog posts very often, so I will generally see what takes my fancy to write about at the time. Well, thank you for reading!

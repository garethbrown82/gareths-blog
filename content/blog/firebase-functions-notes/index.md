I've been a big fan of Firebase for a while and have now used it in a number of project. I've even put together a [video course about it with Manning](https://www.manning.com/livevideo/building-web-applications-with-firebase)

However it's only recently that I've started to use Firebase Cloud Functions. A way to easily develop and deploy cloud functions on the Firebase platform with seemless integration into other Firebase services such as Firestore and the Firebase Local Emulator Suite.

In this tutorial blog post I want to create an API endpoint using Cloud Funcitons where we can create and get notes from Firestore. We'll also develop this functionality using the Firebase Local Emulator Suite.
